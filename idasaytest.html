<p> I grew up with the feeling that the internet was immortal, yet the web is dying, and has been since its birth.
Its aging has been accelerated by the centralization of its operations. The internet once had many doors; today, it's just one vast room.
That different powers control this room is nothing new. Whether to seize power or erase their crimes, they have repeatedly proven how they can easily abuse the situation to enforce their fascist policies.
It is therefore no surprise that France, under the guise of protecting children from pornography, voted for a European bill aimed at authorizing the use of AI for remote mass surveillance.
How can all this be implemented? Probably thanks to malware supplied by Israel, or collusion between the government and Google. 
The last bastions of internet freedom are dying before our very eyes: the end of Wikipedia in the United Kingdom, the suppression of LGBT art, the destruction of anonymous spaces on the internet...
censorship is already a reality, and its impact is undeniable. Faced with this reality, several options are possible, fighting is one of them. 
But I won't dwell on how to fight. I think fighting can manifest itself in many ways, 
and I invite anyone reading these lines to discuss it with their friends and family, to understand their needs, their expectations, their desires, 
with the aim of being able to continue communicating with those you care about, as well as those we know nothing about, and to preserve knowledge in order to be able to pass it on.</p>
